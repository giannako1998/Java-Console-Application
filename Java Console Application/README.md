# 🎭 Reservations Manager (Java Project)

A Java-based **Reservations Management System** developed collaboratively by **three MSc students** at the **University of West Attica (UNIWA)**.  
The application simulates a real-world booking system for **theatrical and musical performances**, allowing users to manage customer data, create and update reservations, and track audience attendance.
